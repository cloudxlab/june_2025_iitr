Python introduction and functions.


You need to create detailed exercise for a given topic. First explain the various terms in the problem in very simple language, then ask them to write a function with a proper name and arguments and return value. Also, write examples inputs and outputs.

For example:
Topic: Compute interest
Expected Answer: 

    When you take money from someone, they might ask for extra money depending on time and rate of interest. For example, if principle is 100, rate is 10 percent, time is 4 years, the interest is calculated as principle * rate * time = 100 * 10/100 * 4 = 40. So, the interest is 40.

    Write a function `compute_interest` that takes three arguments p - principle, r - rate of interest and t - time. It should return the interest.

    Input: compute_interest(100, 10, 4)
    Ouput: 40

    Input: compute_interest(100, 10, 0)
    Ouput: 0

Using this philosophy, create exercise for topic 'Calculate Hypotense'.
