<!-- ## Check if a point P is closer to point A or point B in N-Dimension
## Find nearest neighbour in 1D, 2D and 3D and ND
## Compute mean
## Compute SD


## Compute root mean square error in n-dimensions
## Compute mean absolute error  in n-dimensions
## Compute huber loss
## multiply two polynomials, each polynomial is represented as an array of coefficients
## solve an equation of n variables, you have the values of n-1 variables, find the value of n+1 variables. You have list containing the values of n-1 variables. You have the coffiecients and the right side value available as a list. You have to find the value of first variable. For example:
# you have an equation: 3x + 4y + 6z = 20, you are given the value of y = 5 and z = 6 and you have find the value of x.
# The same is represented as two lists, equation=[3, 4, 6, 20] and vars = [5, 6]
# to find x we need to calculate the following: (20 - (5*4+6*6))/3 
## Come upwith n-1 equations from n equations by eliminating one variable
## Check if a number is an outlier
normalization - min-max, standardizations

multiply a polynomial with a number. A polynomial is represented by the list of coefficients. For example 2x^3 + 3x + 10 is [2, 0, 3, 10]
    
add two polynomials. A polynomial is represented by the list of coefficients. For example 2x^3 + 3x + 10 is [2, 0, 3, 10]

multiply two polynomials. A polynomial is represented by the list of coefficients. For example 2x^3 + 3x + 10 is [2, 0, 3, 10]

    Design fair coin-toss - print Head, TAIL and return 0 for head and 1 for tails. You can only use random.random()

    
    Design biased coin-toss, 70% times head, 30% times tails.
    
    Design biased coin-toss, take p probability of head as arguments.
    
    Design weighted choices function which takes a list of probabilities. It should return the index of the elements with the same weighted chance.

    You are given a list of numbers. Convert them into probabilities such that the total of these decimal numbers is 1. [1,2,2] -> [0.2, .4, .4]

    Design softmax.

    Design weighted choices with temperature.

    
    Flatten an array [1,[1,2,[3,4]]] -> [1,1,2,3,4]
    
    Solve the expression written as array of arrays of three elements: First one is operator and others are operands such as ["*" ["+" 20 40] 90] -> (20+40)*90

    ## Solve Equations - Gaussian Elimination

        ### Build a fit() & predict() for two points with one feature. Manually.
            y = mx + c, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
        
        ### Solve equations - One variable Equation, A*x = B
            solve([[a b]])
        ### Solve equations -  two variables Equation. First eliminate one variable and then use the previous function. 
            - a*x + b*y = c
            - a1*x + b1*y = c1
        
        ### Solve n Equations.
        ### Solve Equations - y = a*x1 + b*x2 + c*x3 + d using above method.

        ### Build a fit() & predict() for n points with n features.
        ### Build a fit() & predict() with y = a*x*x + b*x + c. One feature and three equations

    ## Approximations
    ### What is the minimum value of y = 2*x^2 - 5x + 10 ? try using hit and trial
    ### Write an algorithm to find minimum of second degree polynomial with coeffs [a, b, c].


## Find distance of user_input from given five strings.
menu = ["Food", "Travel", "Clothes", "Games", "Read"]
user_input = "Eat"
Expected output: 0

user_input = "I want to visit Toronto"
Expected output: 1

user_input = "I want to visit Toronto and eat food"
Expected output: 0 or 1 (either)
