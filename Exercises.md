    ## Solve Equations - Gaussian Elimination

        ### Build a fit() & predict() for two points with one feature. Manually.
            y = mx + c, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
        
        ### Solve equations - One variable Equation, A*x = B
            solve([[a b]])
        ### Solve equations -  two variables Equation. First eliminate one variable and then use the previous function. 
            - a*x + b*y = c
            - a1*x + b1*y = c1
        
        ### Solve n Equations.
        ### Solve Equations - y = a*x1 + b*x2 + c*x3 + d using above method.

        ### Build a fit() & predict() for n points with n features.
        ### Build a fit() & predict() with y = a*x*x + b*x + c. One feature and three equations

    ## Approximations
    ### What is the minimum value of y = 2*x^2 - 5x + 10 ? try using hit and trial
    ### Write an algorithm to find minimum of second degree polynomial with coeffs [a, b, c].


## Find distance of user_input from given five strings.
menu = ["Food", "Travel", "Clothes", "Games", "Read"]
user_input = "Eat"
Expected output: 0

user_input = "I want to visit Toronto"
Expected output: 1

user_input = "I want to visit Toronto and eat food"
Expected output: 0 or 1 (either)
