# Binary Search

## Find Square Root using Binary Search

### Explanation:

The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.
For example, the square root of 25 is 5 because $5 \times 5 = 25$.

Instead of using built-in functions like `math.sqrt`, we can use a technique called **binary search** to approximate the square root.
The idea is simple:

1. Suppose we want the square root of `n`.
2. We know the answer will be between `0` and `n` (if `n >= 1`).
3. We repeatedly check the middle of the current range:

   * If `mid * mid` is close to `n`, then `mid` is our answer.
   * If `mid * mid` is too small, we move to the right half.
   * If `mid * mid` is too large, we move to the left half.
4. We continue until the approximation is good enough.

This method is efficient because it cuts the search space in half each time.

### Exercise:

Write a function `sqrt_binary_search(n, precision)` that returns the square root of `n` up to the given decimal precision.

* `n` → the number whose square root we want.
* `precision` → how close we want the answer to be (for example, `0.0001`).

---

### Example:

```python
sqrt_binary_search(25, 0.0001)   # Output: approximately 5.0
sqrt_binary_search(2, 0.0001)    # Output: approximately 1.4142
```

Perfect! Let’s build the same kind of structured exercise for **Cube Root**.

## Compute Cube Root using Binary Search

### Explanation (simple)

The **cube root** of a number `n` is a value `x` such that:

$$
x \times x \times x = n
$$

For example:

* Cube root of 27 is 3 (since $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27$)
* Cube root of 8 is 2.

Instead of using `n ** (1/3)` or `math.pow(n, 1/3)`, we can approximate the cube root using **binary search**.
The idea is similar to finding a square root:

1. Choose a search range where the cube root must lie.
2. Repeatedly check the midpoint.
3. Narrow down the range until we are close enough.

---

### Exercise

Write a function `cuberoot_binary_search(n, precision)` that returns the cube root of `n` up to the given precision.

* **Arguments:**

  * `n`: number (can be positive, negative, or zero).
  * `precision`: small positive float (like `1e-6`).

* **Return:**

  * Approximate cube root of `n` as a float.

---

### Step-by-Step Hints

**Hint 1 — Handle simple cases**

* If `n == 0`, return `0`.
* If `n == 1`, return `1`.
* If `n == -1`, return `-1`.

**Hint 2 — Handle negatives**

* The cube root of a negative number is also negative (e.g., cube root of `-8` is `-2`).
* You can take the cube root of `|n|` (absolute value) and then negate the result.

**Hint 3 — Initial search range**

* If `|n| >= 1`, the cube root lies in `[0, |n|]`.
* If `|n| < 1`, the cube root lies in `[0, 1]`.

**Hint 4 — Midpoint and test**

* Compute `mid = (low + high)/2`.
* Compute `cube = mid*mid*mid`.
* Compare `cube` with `|n|`.

**Hint 5 — Update range**

* If `cube < |n|`, move `low = mid`.
* Else move `high = mid`.

**Hint 6 — Stopping condition**
Stop when `abs(cube - |n|) <= precision`.

**Hint 7 — Return value**

* If `n` was negative, return `-mid`.
* Otherwise return `mid`.

### Example Usage

```python
cuberoot_binary_search(27, 1e-6)   # ≈ 3.0
cuberoot_binary_search(8, 1e-6)    # ≈ 2.0
cuberoot_binary_search(-64, 1e-6)  # ≈ -4.0
cuberoot_binary_search(0.001, 1e-6) # ≈ 0.1
```

## Compute nth Root

### Explanation:

The *nth root* of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself **n** times, gives back the original number.

For example:

* The square root (2nd root) of 16 is 4, because $4 × 4 = 16$.
* The cube root (3rd root) of 27 is 3, because $3 × 3 × 3 = 27$.

In general, the **nth root of a number `x`** is written as:

$$
\sqrt[n]{x} = x^{1/n}
$$

For example:

* $81^{1/4} = 3$, because $3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81$.
* $32^{1/5} = 2$, because $2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 32$.

---

### Exercise:

Write a function `compute_nth_root(x, n)` that takes two numbers:

* `x` → the number you want to find the root of
* `n` → the degree of the root

The function should return the **nth root of x**.

---

### Example:

```python
compute_nth_root(16, 2)   # Output: 4.0  
compute_nth_root(27, 3)   # Output: 3.0  
compute_nth_root(81, 4)   # Output: 3.0  
```

Here’s a well-structured Python exercise for **Compute the Log base 10 using Binary Search**, in the same style as your “Compute Interest” example.

---

## Compute log₁₀(x) with Binary Search

### Explanation:

The base-10 logarithm of a positive number $x$, written $\log_{10}(x)$, is the exponent $y$ such that:

$$
10^y = x
$$

Examples:

* $\log_{10}(100) = 2$ because $10^2 = 100$.
* $\log_{10}(0.01) = -2$ because $10^{-2} = 0.01$.

**Idea:** Instead of using built-in `math.log10`, we can **binary search** for the exponent $y$ so that $10^y$ gets as close as possible to $x$.
Why binary search works: the function $f(y)=10^y$ is **strictly increasing**, so we can keep a low/high range for $y$ and narrow it down until $10^y$ is very close to $x$.

Key points:

* Only defined for **x > 0**.
* If $x = 1$, the answer is **0**.
* If $0 < x < 1$, the result is **negative**.
* We’ll stop when the answer is precise within a small **tolerance** (like `1e-7`).

---

### Exercise:

Write a function `log10_binary_search(x, tol=1e-7)` that returns an approximation of $\log_{10}(x)$.

**Requirements:**

* Parameters:

  * `x` (float): the positive number whose base-10 log you want.
  * `tol` (float): desired precision for the result (default `1e-7`).
* Returns:

  * A float approximating $\log_{10}(x)$ such that `abs(10**ans - x) <= tol * max(1, x)`.
* Behavior:

  * Raise a `ValueError` if `x <= 0`.
  * Use **binary search on the exponent `y`**, not on `x`.
  * First, find a **bracketing range** `[low, high]` such that `10**low <= x <= 10**high`.

    * If `x >= 1`, you can start with `low = 0, high = 1` and keep doubling `high` until `10**high >= x`.
    * If `x < 1`, start with `low = -1, high = 0` and keep doubling the *magnitude* of `low` (e.g., `low *= 2`) until `10**low <= x`.
  * Then binary search within `[low, high]`:

    * Let `mid = (low + high) / 2`.
    * If `10**mid` is less than `x`, move `low = mid`; else move `high = mid`.
    * Stop when `high - low` is small enough (e.g., `< 1e-12`) or when the forward check `abs(10**mid - x)` meets the tolerance.

---

### Example:

```python
log10_binary_search(100)           # Output: 2.0
log10_binary_search(1000)          # Output: 3.0
log10_binary_search(0.01)          # Output: -2.0
round(log10_binary_search(2), 5)   # Output: 0.30103  (approximately)
```

---

### Hints / Checkpoints:

1. **Guardrails:** If `x <= 0`, raise `ValueError`. If `x == 1`, return `0.0`.
2. **Bracket the answer:**

   * `f(y) = 10**y`. You need `low` and `high` such that `f(low) <= x <= f(high)`.
   * Expand outward by doubling the interval on the side that doesn’t yet contain `x`.
3. **Binary search loop:**

   * Compute `mid`; evaluate `f(mid)`.
   * If `f(mid) < x`, move `low = mid`; else `high = mid`.
4. **Stopping rule:**

   * Either `abs(10**mid - x) <= tol * max(1, x)` OR the interval `high - low` is tiny (like `< 1e-12`).
5. **Return:** `mid` (or the midpoint of the final `[low, high]`).

## Compute logₙ(x) with Binary Search

### Explanation:

The logarithm of a positive number $x$ with base $n$ (where $n > 0$ and $n \neq 1$) is the exponent $y$ such that:

$$
n^y = x
$$

Examples:

* $\log_{2}(8) = 3$ because $2^3 = 8$.
* $\log_{3}(81) = 4$ because $3^4 = 81$.
* $\log_{5}(0.04) = -2$ because $5^{-2} = 0.04$.

Instead of using Python’s built-in `math.log(x, n)`, we can use **binary search** on the exponent $y$ to find the answer.
Why? Because the function $f(y) = n^y$ is **strictly increasing** (when $n > 1$) or **strictly decreasing** (when $0 < n < 1$), so binary search will always converge to the correct solution.

---

### Exercise:

Write a function `log_base_n(x, n, tol=1e-7)` that returns an approximation of $\log_{n}(x)$.

**Requirements:**

* Parameters:

  * `x` (float): the number whose log you want. Must be > 0.
  * `n` (float): the base of the logarithm. Must be > 0 and not equal to 1.
  * `tol` (float): the precision of the answer (default `1e-7`).
* Returns:

  * A float approximating $\log_{n}(x)$.
* Behavior:

  * Raise `ValueError` if `x <= 0` or if `n <= 0` or `n == 1`.
  * Use **binary search on exponent `y`**:

    * Find `[low, high]` such that `n**low <= x <= n**high` (or vice versa if `0 < n < 1`).
    * Repeatedly narrow down the range until `n**mid` is close enough to `x`.

---

### Example:

```python
log_base_n(8, 2)      # Output: 3.0
log_base_n(81, 3)     # Output: 4.0
log_base_n(0.04, 5)   # Output: -2.0
round(log_base_n(10, 2), 5)   # Output: 3.32193 (approximately)
```

---

### Hints / Checkpoints:

1. **Guardrails:**

   * If `x <= 0`, raise `ValueError`.
   * If `n <= 0` or `n == 1`, raise `ValueError`.
   * If `x == 1`, return `0.0`.

2. **Bracketing the answer:**

   * If `n > 1`:

     * Start with `[0, 1]` and keep doubling `high` until `n**high >= x`.
     * If `x < 1`, go negative: `[−1, 0]`, doubling `low` downward until `n**low <= x`.
   * If `0 < n < 1`:

     * The function decreases, so inequalities flip — but the idea is the same.

3. **Binary search:**

   * Compute `mid = (low + high) / 2`.
   * If `n**mid` is too small/large compared to `x`, adjust the interval.

4. **Stopping condition:**

   * Stop when `abs(n**mid - x) <= tol * max(1, x)` or interval width `< 1e-12`.
