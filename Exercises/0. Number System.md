# Chapter 0. Number System

## 🔢 **Introduction to Number Systems**

In any number system, we use a set of digits (symbols) to represent numbers. The number of unique digits we use depends on the **base**.
For example:

* **Base 10 (Decimal)**: Uses digits 0 to 9
* **Base 2 (Binary)**: Uses digits 0 and 1
* **Base 8 (Octal)**: Uses digits 0 to 7

In this exercise sequence, you'll get to pick any base between **3 and 13**, and learn how to:

1. Count in that base
2. Add and subtract
3. Write multiplication tables
4. Multiply multi-digit numbers

### ✅ **Step 1: Choose Your Base (Between 3 and 13)**

👉 **Exercise 1:**
Pick a base between **3 and 13** (inclusive).
Let’s call it **Base `b`**.

For example:

* If you choose base 5, your digits will be: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
* If you choose base 12, your digits will be: 0 to 9, then A (for 10), B (for 11)

> For bases higher than 10, we use letters like A=10, B=11, C=12, etc.

✍️ **Write down the digits used in your base.**
For example, in base 6: `0 1 2 3 4 5`

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Write Numbers up to 3 Digits in Your Base**

👉 **Exercise 2:**
Write **all numbers** from `0` to the largest **3-digit number in your base**.

**Explanation:**
In base `b`, a 3-digit number is of the form:

```
A * b² + B * b¹ + C * b⁰
```

Where A, B, C are digits from 0 up to `b-1`.

✅ **Example in base 4**:
Digits: 0, 1, 2, 3
Write all 3-digit numbers (from 000 to 333):

```
000, 001, 002, 003, 010, 011, 012, 013, ..., 333
```

✍️ **Your Task:**
Write down at least 15 3-digit numbers in your base.

---

### ✅ **Step 3: Add and Subtract Single-Digit Numbers in Your Base**

👉 **Exercise 3A: Add all pairs of single-digit numbers in your base**

**Explanation:**
Add two digits and express the result in your base. If the sum is ≥ base, carry over.

✅ **Example in base 5**:

```
3 + 4 = 7 → In base 5: 7 = 1 * 5 + 2 → Answer = 12 (1 carry, 2 below)
```

👉 **Exercise 3B: Subtract all possible pairs of digits**

**Explanation:**
Make sure the result is never negative.
If the first digit is smaller, skip or indicate "not allowed without borrowing".

✅ **Example in base 6**:

```
5 - 2 = 3 → In base 6: still 3
2 - 5 → Not allowed without borrowing
```

✍️ **Your Task:**
Create two tables:

* Addition table: all combinations of digits
* Subtraction table: only where first digit ≥ second digit

---

### ✅ **Step 4: Add and Subtract Multi-Digit Numbers**

👉 **Exercise 4A: Add two 2-digit numbers in your base**

**Example in base 6**:

```
35₆ + 24₆
Step-by-step:
5 + 4 = 9 → 9 = 1 * 6 + 3 → Write 3, carry 1
3 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 6 → 6 = 1 * 6 + 0 → Write 0, carry 1
Result: 103₆
```

👉 **Exercise 4B: Subtract two 2-digit numbers**

**Example in base 7**:

```
52₇ - 34₇ → Convert digits, subtract with borrowing if needed
```

✍️ **Your Task:**
Solve at least 3 addition and 3 subtraction problems involving two-digit numbers.

---

### ✅ **Step 5: Write Multiplication Table in Your Base**

👉 **Exercise 5:**
Create the **multiplication table** for your base up to (b - 1) × (b - 1)

**Explanation:**
Multiply each pair of digits, then convert the result to your base.

✅ **Example in base 4**:

```
2 × 3 = 6 → In base 4: 6 = 1 * 4 + 2 → Answer = 12
```

✍️ **Your Task:**
Make a full multiplication table (rows and columns from 0 to b-1)

---

### ✅ **Step 6: Multiply Two-Digit Numbers in Your Base**

👉 **Exercise 6:**
Multiply two 2-digit numbers in your base

**Example in base 5**:
Multiply 13₅ × 21₅
Steps:

1. Multiply digits as in long multiplication
2. Convert intermediate products to base 5
3. Add all rows (in base 5)

✅ **Step-by-step (summary)**:

* Multiply ones place
* Multiply tens place and shift one place left
* Add rows in base

✍️ **Your Task:**
Multiply at least 2 pairs of 2-digit numbers in your base.
