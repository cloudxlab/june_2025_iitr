# Chapter 1. Python Expressions and Functions:

## Calculate Interest

### **Topic:** *Calculate Interest*

#### **Explanation:**

When someone deposits or borrows money, the amount often grows over time due to *interest*. There are two common types of interest: **Simple Interest** and **Compound Interest**.

In this exercise, we'll focus on **Simple Interest**.

* **Principal (P):** The original amount of money deposited or borrowed.
* **Rate of Interest (R):** The percentage charged or earned on the principal each year.
* **Time (T):** The number of years the money is deposited or borrowed for.

The formula to calculate **Simple Interest** is:

```
Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100
```

This gives us the amount of money earned or paid as interest after the given time.

#### **Problem Statement:**

Write a function named `calculate_interest` that takes the following three arguments:

* `principal` (amount of money deposited or borrowed),
* `rate` (rate of interest per year, as a percentage),
* `time` (duration in years),

and returns the simple interest calculated using the formula above.

#### **Example Usage:**

```python
calculate_interest(1000, 5, 2)   # Output: 100.0
calculate_interest(1500, 4.3, 3) # Output: 193.5
calculate_interest(500, 10, 0)   # Output: 0.0
```


## Calculate Hypotense

### 🧠 Topic: **Calculate Hypotenuse**

#### 📘 Understanding the Terms (in simple language):

When you have a right-angled triangle (a triangle where one of the angles is exactly 90 degrees), the longest side of the triangle is called the **hypotenuse**. It’s the side that is **opposite the right angle**.

The other two sides (the ones that make the right angle) are usually called the **base** and the **height** (or **perpendicular**).

To calculate the length of the hypotenuse, we use something called the **Pythagorean Theorem**.

The formula is:

```
hypotenuse² = base² + height²
```

To find the hypotenuse, we need to take the square root of the sum of the squares of the base and height:

```
hypotenuse = √(base² + height²)
```

#### 🔧 Task:

Write a function named `calculate_hypotenuse` that takes two arguments:

* `base`: the length of the base (a number)
* `height`: the length of the height/perpendicular side (a number)

It should return the length of the hypotenuse (a number).

Use the formula:

```
hypotenuse = (base² + height²) ** 0.5
```

#### 💡 Examples:

```python
Input: calculate_hypotenuse(3, 4)
Output: 5.0
```

Why?
Because √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5.0

---

```python
Input: calculate_hypotenuse(5, 12)
Output: 13.0
```

Why?
Because √(25 + 144) = √169 = 13.0

---

```python
Input: calculate_hypotenuse(0, 0)
Output: 0.0
```

## Find Distance 2D

**Topic:** *Find Distance in 2D*

### 🧠 Explanation:

In everyday life, when we move from one place to another, we cover a certain *distance*. In math, especially in geometry, we often want to calculate the distance between two points on a flat surface (called a 2D plane).

Each point on this plane can be represented by two numbers:

* the **x-coordinate** (horizontal position)
* the **y-coordinate** (vertical position)

Come up with the formula to calculate the distance between two points $(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$ based on the **Pythagorean Theorem**, just like finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

---

### ✍️ Exercise:

Write a function `find_distance_2d(x1, y1, x2, y2)` that returns the distance between the two points. Use the formula mentioned above. You can use the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the square root.

---

### 💡 Examples:

```python

find_distance_2d(0, 0, 3, 4)     # Output: 5.0
find_distance_2d(1, 2, 4, 6)     # Output: 5.0

```

## Find Distance 3D

**Topic:** *Find Distance in 3D*

---

### 🧠 **Explanation:**

In everyday life, we often measure the distance between two points—like how far your house is from school. In **3D space**, we do the same, but we also consider height or depth in addition to length and width.

A point in 3D space is defined using three coordinates:

* `x` (horizontal)
* `y` (vertical)
* `z` (depth)

To calculate the **distance between two points** in 3D, say:

* Point A: `(x1, y1, z1)`
* Point B: `(x2, y2, z2)`

Come up with 3D distance formula using the Pythagorean theorem into three dimensions.

---

### 🧪 **Exercise:**

Write a function called `calculate_distance_3d(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)` that returns the distance between two 3D points.

* The function should return the result as a float.
* You can use the built-in `math.sqrt()` function to calculate the square root.

---

### ✅ **Examples:**

```

calculate_distance_3d(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)  # Output: 1.7320508075688772
calculate_distance_3d(2, 3, 5, 2, 3, 5)  # Output: 0.0
calculate_distance_3d(1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9)  # Output: 7.810249675906654

```


## Find Manhattan Distance

### **Topic:** *Find Manhattan Distance*

---

### **Explanation:**

When you want to measure the distance between two points on a grid (like in a city with square blocks), you don’t move diagonally. Instead, you move only **horizontally** and **vertically**, like a taxi driving along streets and avenues. This kind of distance is called the **Manhattan Distance**.

The formula to calculate the Manhattan Distance between two points $(x1, y1)$ and $(x2, y2)$ is:

$$
\text{Manhattan Distance} = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|
$$

Here, $|a|$ means the absolute value of $a$ — in other words, how far the number is from zero.

For example:

* From (2, 3) to (5, 1):
$|2 - 5| = 3$ and $|3 - 1| = 2$, so distance = $3 + 2 = 5$

---

### **Exercise:**

Write a function `manhattan_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)` that takes the coordinates of two points and returns their Manhattan Distance.

---

### **Example:**

```python
manhattan_distance(2, 3, 5, 1)  # Output: 5
manhattan_distance(0, 0, 0, 0)  # Output: 0
manhattan_distance(-1, -1, 1, 1)  # Output: 4
```


## **Topic:** *Predict Y on a Straight Line (2D)*

---

### **Simple Explanation:**

In math, a straight line in 2D is usually written in this form:

```
y = m * x + c
```

Here’s what the terms mean:

* `x` is the input (like a point on the horizontal axis).
* `y` is the output (like a point on the vertical axis).
* `m` is the *slope* of the line, which tells us how steep the line is.
* `c` is the *intercept*, or where the line crosses the y-axis.

For example:
If `m = 2`, `c = 3`, and `x = 4`, then:

```
y = 2 * 4 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
```

So, the value of `y` is `11`.

---

### **Exercise:**

Write a function `predict(m, c, x)` that returns the value of `y` based on the formula:

```
y = m * x + c
```

#### **Arguments:**

* `m` – slope of the line (a number)
* `c` – y-intercept of the line (a number)
* `x` – the x-coordinate (a number)

#### **Return:**

* The value of `y` calculated from the formula `y = m * x + c`

---

### **Example Usage:**

```python
predict(2, 3, 4)     # Output: 11
predict(-1, 5, 2)    # Output: 3
```


## Given two points, write a function fit() to learn slope and intercept of the line going through them

### **Topic:** *Learn Line Equation from Two Points*

### **Explanation:**

A straight line in a 2D plane can be described by the equation:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

Where:

* `m` is the **slope** of the line.
* `c` is the **intercept** — the value of `y` when `x = 0`.

If you're given **two points** on the line, say `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, you can calculate the **slope** `m` like this:

$$
m = \frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}
$$

Once you have the slope, you can use one of the points (say `(x1, y1)`) to calculate the intercept `c` using:

$$
c = y1 - m \times x1
$$

For example, if your two points are (1, 2) and (3, 6):

* Slope: `(6 - 2)/(3 - 1) = 4/2 = 2`
* Intercept: `2 - (2 × 1) = 0`
* So, the equation of the line is: `y = 2x + 0`

---

### **Exercise:**

Write a function `fit(x1, y1, x2, y2)` that returns a tuple `(m, c)` representing the slope and intercept of the line passing through the two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.

---

### **Function Signature:**

```python
def fit(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Your code here
```

---

### **Example:**

```python
fit(1, 2, 3, 6)       # Output: (2.0, 0.0)
fit(0, 5, 2, 9)       # Output: (2.0, 5.0)
```

> 💡 **Hint:** Make sure `x1` is not equal to `x2`, otherwise the slope would be undefined (vertical line). You may handle this case as you see fit.


## find first derivaative of a function that takes only one argument. 

### **Topic:** *Find First Derivative of a Function*

#### **Simple Explanation:**

In mathematics, the *derivative* of a function tells us how fast the function's value is changing at a particular point.

Think of it like this: if you’re driving a car and your distance changes every second, then your speed is the derivative of your distance. Similarly, for any function, the derivative gives the *rate of change*.

We’ll use a simple numerical technique called the **difference method**:

$$
f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

This is called the **forward difference method**, where `h` is a very small number.

---

### **Exercise:**

Write a function `approx_derivative(func, x, h)` that:

* Takes a function `func` that accepts a single argument,
* A value `x` where we want to find the derivative,
* And a small number `h` (like `0.0001`),
* Returns the approximate derivative of `func` at `x`.

---

### **Example Usage:**

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

def cube(x):
    return x * x * x

print(approx_derivative(square, 3, 0.0001))  # Output: Approx. 6
print(approx_derivative(cube, 2, 0.0001))    # Output: Approx. 12
```

---

### **Note to Learner:**

Try different values of `x` and different functions (like `math.sin`, `math.exp`, etc.) to see how the derivative changes.

Make sure to import any libraries (like `math`) if needed.
