## Word Count Using Dictionary

### Explanation:

When you have a huge block of text, sometimes you want to know how many times each word appears. For example, in a book or an article, some words occur many times (like *the*, *and*), while others occur only once.

We can solve this problem by using a **dictionary** in Python:

* The *keys* of the dictionary will be the words.
* The *values* will be how many times each word appears in the text.

For example, in the text `"hello world hello"`,
the dictionary would look like:
`{"hello": 2, "world": 1}`

This is called a **word count**.

### Exercise:

Write a function `word_count(text)` that:

* Takes a string `text` as input.
* Splits the text into words (you can use `split()`).
* Counts how many times each word appears using a dictionary.
* Returns the dictionary of word counts.

ðŸ’¡ **Hint**: You can test your function using the large file provided:

```python
txt = open('/cxldata/big.txt').read()
```

### Example:

```python
word_count("hello world hello")
# Output: {'hello': 2, 'world': 1}

word_count("apple orange apple banana orange")
# Output: {'apple': 2, 'orange': 2, 'banana': 1}
```

## Find Anagrams in a Text

### Explanation:

An **anagram** is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word.
For example:

* `"listen"` and `"silent"` are anagrams.
* `"evil"` and `"vile"` are also anagrams.

To find anagrams in a large text, one useful trick is to use a **dictionary (hash map)**:

* We can sort the letters of each word to form a *key*.

  * Example: `"listen"` â†’ `"eilnst"`, `"silent"` â†’ `"eilnst"`.
* All words that share the same sorted key are anagrams of each other.
* We group words together in the dictionary using these keys.

This method is very efficient, even for huge texts.

---

### Exercise:

Write a function `find_anagrams(text)` that:

1. Splits the given text into words.
2. Uses a dictionary to group words that are anagrams of each other.
3. Returns a dictionary where:

   * The key is the sorted letters (like `"eilnst"`).
   * The value is a list of words that are anagrams.

You can test your function using a big text file:

```python
txt = open('/cxldata/big.txt').read()
```

---

### Example:

```python
find_anagrams("listen silent enlist inlets hello world")
# Possible Output:
# {
#   'eilnst': ['listen', 'silent', 'enlist', 'inlets'],
#   'ehllo': ['hello'],
#   'dlorw': ['world']
# }
```

```python
find_anagrams("evil vile live veil")
# Output:
# {
#   'eilv': ['evil', 'vile', 'live', 'veil']
# }
```

## Build an Expense Tracker

### Explanation:

When you spend money, you usually want to keep track of **where the money is going**. For example, you might spend on *food*, *rent*, *travel*, and so on. An **expense tracker** helps you organize your spending by category (also called *expense head*).

We can build a simple tracker using a **dictionary**:

* The *keys* will be the expense heads (like `"food"`, `"rent"`, `"travel"`).
* The *values* will be the total amount spent under that head.

We will write **two functions**:

1. `update_expenses(expense_list, expenses_dict)` â†’ updates the dictionary with new expenses.

   * `expense_list` is a list of tuples like `[("food", 200), ("rent", 1000)]`.
   * `expenses_dict` is the dictionary where totals are stored.

2. `print_expenses(expenses_dict)` â†’ prints the overall expenses under each head in a clean way.

---

### Exercise:

Write the following functions:

```python
def update_expenses(expense_list, expenses_dict):
    """
    Updates the dictionary with expenses from the list.
    Each element of expense_list is a tuple: (expense_head, amount).
    If the head already exists, add to its total.
    Otherwise, create a new entry.
    """
    pass


def print_expenses(expenses_dict):
    """
    Prints all expense heads and their total amounts.
    Example format:
    food : 500
    rent : 1000
    """
    pass
```

---

### Example Usage:

```python
expenses = {}

update_expenses([("food", 200), ("rent", 1000)], expenses)
update_expenses([("food", 300), ("travel", 150)], expenses)

print_expenses(expenses)
```

**Expected Output:**

```
food : 500
rent : 1000
travel : 150
```
